# CSC 211 Demos & Labs GitHub Repository

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is on online hosted service that provides a widely-used software development version control solution. In lameman's terms, it is a platform that allows us a place to store our code and manage edits/changes to it (version control). This way, we can easily share code we develop and collaborate with others on projects.

## What do I use GitHub for in this class?
For our course, I will only be using GitHub as a means of sharing my code. You don't *need* to know about version control or committing, cloning, pushing, pulling, etc. but I **highly encourage** you guys on your own time to look up some tutorials on YouTube that break down how to use GitHub. It is a very powerful tool and is widely used across *all professional settings*. 

Whether it be in your upper division classes or in your work life, you will inevitably develop software alongisde a group of other people, and if each of you go editing files without some way of communicating who is working on what or making which changes where, it is utter chaos and code gets lost all the time.

## How do I use GitHub?
Simply navigate to the code that we are using for the day's lecture/lab and download it from GitHub. The interface is very user friendly and there is a highly visible "Download" button when viewing each file.
